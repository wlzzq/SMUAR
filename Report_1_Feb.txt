Augmented reality experience at Saint Martin's University

Description: An augmented reality application to allow students and staff at Saint Martin's University to 
have a fun and exciting experience. The application will use the camera on the userâ€™s smartphone to display 
videos, tutorials , news and guides, this works by developing a camera application that identifies specific 
objects or shapes such as barcodes and once the camera recognizes that shape then the shape will be replaced 
by an augmented object.

Role: I will be the developer of the augmented reality application.

Two week progress: So far I have searched for similar ideas on the net to get a better view on how to create such application.

Team progress: I am currently working alone on the project so no team progress made at this point.
