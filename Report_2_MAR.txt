I have researched on the augmented reality topic, and I have found the following:

    The developer will need to have a good understanding of 3D shapes (X, Y, and Z axis)

    I will use Unity to develop the application and for that I will have to learn how Unity works and can one apply 
    augmented reality features to a project

    The programming language that will be used to develop this project is C#

    Understanding how images can be transformed into a video or another image is important.


Challenges:

    Learning curve will increase for the developer

    Time management will have to be addressed in order for the developer to keep track of what is done  


Significant progress:

    No significant progress have been made at this point other than researching more about the topic and 
    identifying challenges that the developer may run into
