    1. Description: An Augmented reality application to help students and faculty
       at Saint martin University navigate the campus, explore buildings, and learn
       how to operate special tools such as fire extinguishers and printers.
       
    2. Role: I will be the project manager and the developer
    
    3. I have contacted my potential client and we have agreed to meet to 
       go over what are they looking for in an application my client were kind enough to
       provide me with enough information to get me starting on working on the application.
       my client will be the "Admission office at Saint martin's university"  

          - my client needs:

            Application that reads QR codes that could be placed on buildings around campus.
            once the code is scanned the application would play a video and/or display useful facts about the building.

    4. Significant change: I have a new client that is willing to support my idea 
       and my idea is slightly changed to meet my client's requirements.
