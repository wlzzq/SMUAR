1- I am working on refining our design to make it look presentable, I have learnt how to create a 3d object using unity. For the QR cods we might just rely on some unique objects for the camera to recognize, though I have found a lot of sources online that generate free QR coeds

2- We have made some  progress regarding the application,

 .- Creating an actual application and testing it  on an Adriano phone

  - Testing the camera application to see what conditions would make the camera stop recognizing objects
